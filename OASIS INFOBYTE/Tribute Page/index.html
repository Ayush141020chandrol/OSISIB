                Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
                one of the two pillars of modern physics. He is best known for his equation E=mcÂ²,
                which explains the relationship between energy and mass. Einstein received the Nobel Prize
                in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
